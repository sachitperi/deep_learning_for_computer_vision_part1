The process of constructing a graph of nodes and associated connections in a network and saving 
the graph of nodes and associated connections in a network and saving the graph to disk as an 
image (PNG, JPG, etc.). Nodes in the graph represent layers, while connections between nodes 
represent the flow of data through the network. 
These graphs typically include the following components for each layer 
1. The input volume size 
2. The output volume size 
3. And optionally the name of the layer 

Network architecture visualization is typically used when 
1. Debugging our own custom network architectures 
2. publication 
where a visualization of architecture is easier to understand than including the actual source 
code or trying to construct a table to convey thee same information.
